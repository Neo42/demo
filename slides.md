# Problem We Are Solving

<!--
The problem we are trying to solve is that many data analysts or business analysts have to use InfluxDB for analysing time-series data in their daily work but donâ€™t have programming skills or are unfamiliar with the Flux language. Those analysts are the typical users who will use our software. But other than that, because we have implemented screen reader voice-over accessibility on our user interface, our software is also accessible to those who are visually impaired.
